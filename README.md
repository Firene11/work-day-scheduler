## Description
This is a simple daily planner application to create a schedule. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours, when you view the timeblocks for that day - each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 

## Installation
