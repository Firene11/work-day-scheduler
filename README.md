# work-day-scheduler

## Description
This is a simple daily planner application to create a schedule. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours, when you view the timeblocks for that day - each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 

## Installation

## Usage
You can click into a timeblock and enter an event and click the save button for that timeblock. Then the text for that event is saved in local storage. When you refresh the page the saved events remain.
